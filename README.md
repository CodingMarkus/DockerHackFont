### New!

You can now modify the default line spacing in Hack fonts with our new `font-line` tool.  Hack uses a default value of 20% UPM for line spacing.  Decrease the value to tighten the spacing, increase it to widen your spacing.  Modification details are available on the `font-line` repository:

https://github.com/source-foundry/font-line

or [use one of our handy shell scripts](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack/tree/master/tools/line-spacing) that automates the `font-line` install and line spacing modification process for a range of line spacing % UPM values between 10 - 30%.  Select the script that fits your needs and execute it in the download directory that contains your .ttf and/or .otf font files **before you install them**.

### About

No frills. No gimmicks.  Hack is hand groomed and optically balanced to be a workhorse face for code.

It has deep roots in the libre, open source typeface community and expands upon the contributions of the Bitstream Vera &amp; DejaVu projects.  The face has been re-designed with a larger glyph set, modifications of the original glyph shapes (including distinct point styles and semi-bold punctuation weight in the regular set to make analphabetic characters less transparent), and meticulous attention to metrics (including numerous spacing adjustments to improve the rhythm of the face and the legibility of code at small text sizes).  The large x-height + wide aperture + low contrast design combined with PostScript hinting/hint replacement programs and a TrueType instruction set make it highly legible at commonly used source code text sizes with a sweet spot that runs in the 8px - 12px range on modern desktop and laptop monitors.  Combine it with an HD monitor and you can comfortably work at 6 or 7px sizes. The full set of changes are available in the [changelog](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

The font binaries are released under a license that permits unlimited print, desktop, and web use for commercial and non-commercial applications.  It may be embedded and distributed in documents and applications.  The source is released in the widely supported UFO format and may be modified to derive new typeface branches.  The full text of the license is available in [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack/blob/master/LICENSE.md)
