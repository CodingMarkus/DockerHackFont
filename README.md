### a typeface designed for source code

<!-- TODO add links to bitstream vera and dejavu projects -->

No frills. No gimmicks. Hack is hand groomed and optically balanced to be a workhorse face for code. It has deep roots in the libre, open source typeface community and expands upon the contributions of the [Bitstream Vera]() &amp; [DejaVu]() projects.

### New!

You can now modify the default line spacing in Hack fonts with our new `font-line` tool.  Hack uses a default value of 20% UPM for line spacing.  Decrease the value to tighten the spacing, increase it to widen your spacing.  Modification details are available on the `font-line` repository:

https://github.com/source-foundry/font-line

or [use one of our handy shell scripts](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack/tree/master/tools/line-spacing) that automates the `font-line` install and line spacing modification process for a range of line spacing % UPM values between 10 - 30%.  Select the script that fits your needs and execute it in the download directory that contains your .ttf and/or .otf font files **before you install them**.
