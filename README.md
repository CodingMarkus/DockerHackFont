### a typeface designed for source code

No frills. No gimmicks. Hack is hand groomed and optically balanced to be a workhorse face for code. It has deep roots in the libre, open source typeface community and expands upon the contributions of the [Bitstream Vera](https://www.gnome.org/fonts/) &amp; [DejaVu](http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Main_Page) projects.

## Quick installation

We recommended using the **TrueType** (`.ttf`) version of Hack. An OpenType (`.otf`) build is also available.

#### Mac OS X and Linux

1. Download the [latest version of Hack](ttf_latest).
2. Extract the files from the archive (`.zip`) and open them.
3. Follow the instructions from your operating system.
4. Enjoy!

**NOTE**: If you are updating your version of Hack, be sure to remove the previously installed version first to avoid conflicts. For more information, see [INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md).

#### Windows

To simplify the installation process on Windows systems, we recommend using the [Hack Windows Installer](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack-windows-installer/releases/tag/v1.1.2) (`.exe`) which will guide you through the installation process.

### New!

You can now modify the default line spacing in Hack fonts with our new `font-line` tool.  Hack uses a default value of 20% UPM for line spacing.  Decrease the value to tighten the spacing, increase it to widen your spacing.  Modification details are available on the `font-line` repository:

https://github.com/source-foundry/font-line

or [use one of our handy shell scripts](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack/tree/master/tools/line-spacing) that automates the `font-line` install and line spacing modification process for a range of line spacing % UPM values between 10 - 30%.  Select the script that fits your needs and execute it in the download directory that contains your .ttf and/or .otf font files **before you install them**.
