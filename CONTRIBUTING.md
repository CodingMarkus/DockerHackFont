## Hack Typeface Design

Hack is a monospaced typeface that is designed to optimize the display of source code text.


### Primary Design Targets

- ASCII glyph set (used to display the body of all source code text)
- font sizes between 8 - 14 px
- cross-platform, cross font renderer support on Linux, OS X, and Windows operating systems
- desktop text editor text displays
- terminal emulator text displays
- website text displays
- print text displays


### Primary Design Optimizations

- legibility - establish differences in the appearance of similar glyph shapes so as to properly identify different Unicode code points
- readability - glyph shape and spacing optimizations to improve the capacity to read character-character, word-word, and code block-code block combinations in source code
- visual semantics - establish semantic commonalities for glyphs used in source code text and create common visual designs within these semantic groups


### Secondary Design Targets

- All glyphs outside of the ASCII set (including extended character sets used for the display of comments in source code)
- All font sizes outside of the primary design targets
- All forms of text display outside of the primary design targets
